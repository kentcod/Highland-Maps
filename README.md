# Highland-Maps

This repository contains maps produced for James Monroe Highland as part of the William and Mary Institute for Integrative Conservation's year-long research program. To easily view the final map results without having to open ArcGIS software, open the provided layouts (JPG files). 

Layout Ailanthus Abundance: 

Layout Compartment Invasion: polygons color-coded by invasive cover class (0-5% invasion = cover class 1; 5-25% invasion = cover class 2; 25-50% invasion = cover class 3; 50-75% invasion = cover class 4; 75-100% invasion = cover class 5). Due to brush overgrowth and lack of trails in some areas, I could not survey all orginally specified polygons within the Highland property boundary. However, with enough data wrangling, the optimized machine learning algorithm tested in the Highland-Code repository predicted unsurveyed compartments. The  layout shows a legend for layers used either for reference for surveying in the field or for machine learning efforts. Other features used for machine learning that are not displayed in the legend are distance and elevation from floodplain, which were computed using a series of geoprocessing tools. Labeled compartments represent Highland ID (HID), which was used to reference each compartment while surveying in the field.
